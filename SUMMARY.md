# Summary

When creating a Web app, you need a foundation on which to build. There are
a lot of disparate technologies out there that can be brought together into
a cohesive whole to make this happen. The trouble is in finding, vetting,
testing, and combining these technologies -- all of which needs to happen
before you can begin to make serious progress on your own project.

Bedrock helps you launch your ideas faster by bundling all the best-of-breed
tooling that's necessary to build a modern, scalable Web app. It creates a
solid foundation on which you can build, letting you focus on your
project-specific needs.

Bedrock uses a modular design to help keep code well-organized and to allow an
ecosystem to grow without unnecessary hindrance. Bedrock keeps its core simple:
it provides a powerful configuration system, an event-based API, Linked
Data-capabilities, and testing infrastructure that makes writing interactive
modules easy. Bedrock is an opinionated, but flexible framework; it tells
developers that there's one recommended way to accomplish a task, but if need
be, a developer can go in another direction. Many of Bedrock's modules attempt
to emulate this approach, creating organizing priniciples and clear guidelines
for developers to follow that help break down problems and reduce cognitive
load.

Bedrock uses node.js and runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It can run on a
low-powered laptop all the way up to an enterprise server.
